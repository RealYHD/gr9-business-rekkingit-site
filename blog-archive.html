Great news everyone, we are beginning a partnership with The Source®! Now, it will be even easier for us to deliver our services! Instead of trying to figure out how to install that RAM into your computer after your purchase, we can install it right there for you! Less hassle and time. We expect for most of our in store support to be setup by January 27th.
            </p>
            <p>
            We also have more great deals for all of you in spirit of Cyber Monday! Our hardware installation department is allowing up to a 25% off! Our virus removal department will also be lowering the prices for all level 1 issues! Got a computer that broke down for whatever reason and need it back up? Most likely an issue that we can take care of. If it's not a virus for example, we will let you know and redirect you to the correct department for free of charge!
            </p>
            <p>
            Remember, Cyber Monday only lasts Monday, get all your computer issues fixed on that day and tell your friends!

                The amount of customers we’ve received for the past week was incredible! Speaking of which, we hope that all of you have taken advantage of those coupons for our various departments. If you missed out, don’t worry as there will be more coming as the holiday season draws near.
            </p>
            <p>
Media will be bigger and bigger on our website. Photos of the process, and skill our service will take will soon be made available in a very easy way! We have also finally began the long awaited sections on our website to show our different departments in greater detail.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a more serious note: Our amazing services are no longer restricted to Manitoba, and Minnesota. We have begun construction in a new province that we have yet delivered our service to. This is all possible by the enormous support and loyalty we’ve been receiving from our customers!
            </p>
            <p>
                We have been developing at a nice, safe, yet extraordinary pace and we are very grateful for the patience of our customers for the great things to come.

                Time to update the news for all our beloved customers! There has been a lot of exciting changes here at RekkingIT!
            </p>
            <p>
            First of all, we would like to announce our success at moving to our new location at 400 South Drive! It has been a very smooth transition. Our new location allows us to provide the best service possible with no delays. With that being said, we would like to celebrate this special event by offering a discount up to 11% for our most popular services. This special event will continue until the 21st of November.
            </p>
            <p>
            All that aside, we would also like to give a status update for our website. We will be choosing a new color scheme and adding more information on what we do and contact information We will also be introducing a few demonstrations of how our departments work. This should all be coming in the few weeks to come.
            </p>
            <p>
            We’d like to thank you all for your loyalty and continued support to RekkingIT. Hope you’ve had a great weekend.

                It’s November, and it’s getting colder and colder. Because of that, or servers are working at optimal speeds! 
            </p>
            <p>
                We have finally added the new department we noted in our last post.The new department being data recovery. Our data recovery service will spring to action for those in need starting on November 16 2015. That is not all as our website will be getting a new look very soon and new pages will be added.
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like to remind everyone that the new contact page will be the new way to register for our support as it is easier and will be more organized on our side.
             </p>
            <p>
                All those fun things aside, we have had more and more happy customers. And your support has helped us a lot.  We would like to thank all of our customers on behalf of CEO Rekai Musuka and COO Harrison Deng for choosing our company.

                The first question people ask us is: “What makes us different from the rest?” Honestly, there is only so much an IT company can do. What we can do is outclass our competitors in the core fields related to IT companies. Whether it be a change in operating systems, virus removal, or connectivity issues. We formed this IT company because we realize that technology is the fastest developing industry out there. People, and businesses will need help from time to time.
            </p>
            <p>
                You’ve heard the reasons behind our business. Now it’s time for us to explain how we will keep our promise. It’s simple. We will outclass our competitors because we have a great team of great people and technicians that are always willing to help and support you or your business in any way they can. There are a lot of ways for us to help since we have multiple departments including but not limited to: network administration, hardware repairs/installation/upgrades and virus removal.
