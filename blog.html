            <p>December 14 2015
                <br><br>
                We’re a little ways into december and it’s finally snowed Outside of our office, all of the patches of green grass are now covered with a fresh blanket of snow! The green grass is truly gone now. Speaking of green, we’re now accepting old computers! We plan to either properly dispose of them or mix and match parts and send refurbished computers to needy schools in Winnipeg! It doesn’t matter whether you bring a laptop or a computer, we’ll work something out. After all we’re the best IT company in the world.             </p>
            <p>
                On an unrelated note, our “Twelve Days of Tech Support” Sale is going to begin! From December 13 to December 25 services will be up to 75% off* You will also get a complimentary christmas hat usb.
            </p>
            <p>
As the end of the year is approaching we have to wonder about what we will do in the new year. And after careful consideration we have decided that we will close down temporarily. Don’t worry loyal customers, after some new year's renovations we will be in full swing and better than ever. We ask for your patience during the new year. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Nethertheless enjoy your holidays everyone!

                December’s finally here and there’s... grass outside? Along with the warm weather RekkingIT is heating up we will be updating our website to make the overall design more “homey” by adding pictures. We can’t wait to show you what we have in store.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, our site is now more friendlier than ever with our new tabs for information based on all our separate departments. Each tab has instructions on how you can get the most of our services. We also added the archive tab to prevent too much clutter on the main blog page.
            </p>
            <p>
We also added a few pictures to give some demonstration as to how we fulfill our tasks. This was all thanks to loyal customers that allowed us to capture a few moments while we were assisting.
            </p>
            <p>
            Also, a little teaser to get all of you excited, we are going to allow price drops for all our loyal customers out there starting on December 13.
            </p>
            <p>
            Thanks for supporting us over the past few months and we can’t wait for the holidays!
                <br>COO Harrison Deng
